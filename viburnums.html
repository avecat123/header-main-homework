    <h3>All About Viburnums</h3>

    <p>Viburnums have long been one of the most popular flowering landscape shrubs. There are over 150 species of Viburnum. You can find a variety to suit any garden need: wet or dry, sun or shade, natural or formal, shrub or tree, native or exotic, <abbr title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</abbr> Zones 2–9.</p>

    <p>Bloom times span early spring through June and are followed by attractive fruit and outstanding fall foliage.</p>

    <p>Viburnums are well behaved members of the honeysuckle family. They are either shrubs or trees. The tree forms may require pruning to achieve the desired shape. The U.S. National Arboretum has done extensive breeding for hardy, pest-resistant varieties.</p>

    <p>Viburnums work great as hedges or in mass groupings and also make interesting specimen plants or anchors in borders.</p>

    <p>Most viburnums prefer full sun but will adjust to partial shade. They like moderately fertile soil with a pH between 5.6–6.6, although many do just fine in alkaline soils.</p>

    <p>Few pests bother viburnums, which adds to their popularity. Recently, the Viburnum Leaf Beetle (VLB) has been introduced into North America through Canada and has begun moving south.</p>
